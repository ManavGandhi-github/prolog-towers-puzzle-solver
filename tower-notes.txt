 For identifying ambiguous Towers puzzles, where a single set of edge counts yields more than one unique solution, extensive testing was conducted across various puzzle sizes. The results highlighted below illustrate the complexity and depth of the Towers puzzle, confirming the existence of multiple solutions for specific configurations:

I ran the following command to find ambiguous puzzles for various sizes.

For N=4:
?- ambiguous(4, C, T1, T2).
Results:
C = counts([4,2,2,1],[1,2,2,4],[4,2,2,1],[1,2,2,4])
T1 = [[1,2,3,4],[2,1,4,3],[3,4,1,2],[4,3,2,1]]
T2 = [[1,2,3,4],[2,4,1,3],[3,1,4,2],[4,3,2,1]]


For N=6:
?- ambiguous(6, C, T1, T2).
Results:
C = counts([6,3,4,2,2,1],[1,2,2,4,2,4],[6,3,4,2,2,1],[1,2,2,4,2,4])
T1 = [[1,2,3,4,5,6],[2,1,4,3,6,5],[3,4,5,6,1,2],[4,3,6,5,2,1],[5,6,1,2,3,4],[6,5,2,1,4,3]]
T2 = [[1,2,3,4,5,6],[2,1,4,6,3,5],[3,4,2,5,6,1],[4,6,5,3,1,2],[5,3,6,1,2,4],[6,5,1,2,4,3]]


For N=7:
?- ambiguous(7, C, T1, T2).
Results:
C = counts([7,4,4,2,3,2,1],[1,2,2,4,2,4,4],[7,4,3,4,2,2,1],[1,2,2,2,3,4,6])
T1 = [[1,2,3,4,5,6,7],[2,1,4,3,6,7,5],[3,4,1,2,7,5,6],[4,5,6,7,1,2,3],[5,3,7,6,2,1,4],[6,7,2,5,3,4,1],[7,6,5,1,4,3,2]]
T2 = [[1,2,3,4,5,6,7],[2,1,4,3,6,7,5],[3,4,1,2,7,5,6],[4,5,6,7,1,2,3],[5,7,2,6,3,1,4],[6,3,7,5,2,4,1],[7,6,5,1,4,3,2]]



(Above are examples of ambiguous puzzles found with my Prolog program for sizes N=4, N=6, and N=7.)

To measure the speedup gained by using the finite domain solver over a brute-force approach, I used the following test case:

?- speedup(Ratio).

This command calculated the execution speed ratio between ntower/3 and plain_ntower/3 using a predefined puzzle configuration. The result demonstrated the efficiency of the finite domain solver approach:

Ratio = 25.625

This indicates that the solution involving the finite domain solver is significantly more efficient than the plain solution approach.
